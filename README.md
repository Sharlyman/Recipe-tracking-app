Recipe Tracking App Using React

A mock recipe-tracking CRUD app interface with a focus on rendering and state management using React.

This project was a great way to practice the following:

utilizing the useState() hook
lifting up state through a component tree
handling events
creating a form and storing state inside a form object
using the single-responsibility principle for React components
The user can create a new recipe, view a list of existing recipes and delete a recipe. Data is displayed in a table.
